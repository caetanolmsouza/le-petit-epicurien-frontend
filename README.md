# Le Petit Épicurien

This website was created by Caetano Souza, Guarav Sharma and Stéphane Deias,
the objective is to facilitate the search and the reservation for a restaurant in Paris. Here you can find a restaurant and make a reservation for a table, ask for some special request, and you can also see all your reservations and change them if needed, or even cancel a reservation you've made. All the restaurants from this website come from the website [The Fork](https://www.thefork.fr/).
